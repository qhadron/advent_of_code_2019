# Advent of Code 2019 Solutions

Here are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2019](https://github.com/qhadron/advent_of_code_2019.git).

Inside the files are comments about how to solve the problem.

## Running

### Javascript

The Javascript source files can be run directly in the browser's developer tools. In most browsers press F12 and paste the code after logging in to get your personalized input.


### C/C++

There is a `Makefile` for this project. If you don't have `clang`/`clang++` installed, set the `CXX`/`CC` variables.

Here's how to use the Makefile:
```bash
# build and run the file
make day_3.cpp.run

# build the file only
make ./.exe/day_3.cpp.run
```
